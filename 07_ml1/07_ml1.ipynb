    "This usually leads to erroneous conclusions in many machine learning models (SVM, neural networks, etc.), since most are based on the Euclidean distance measure resp. gradient descent. Thus, in the example, the age would clearly dominate the number of children, just by the fact that the numerical value is larger. This has nothing to do with the underlying mechanisms that are supposed to be trained.\n",
    "\n",
    "For tree-based algorithms (decision tree, random forest, etc.), the situation is somewhat different. These algorithms determine a split of the data based only on the properties of an attribute. This is to increase the homogeneity in a node. However, this also means that other features and thus their scale level do not influence this split. Tree-based algorithms are therefore invariant to different scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of data analysis, **normalization** and **standardization** are particularly relevant as scaling techniques. Normalization means that the data is scaled to the closed interval [0, 1]. With standardization, the data is transformed to mean value zero and standard deviation one. Now, which technique is used under which circumstances? There is no general answer to this question. However, some hints can be given that can be considered when making a choice. If the data certainly do not follow a normal distribution, then the obvious choice is to use normalization. In particular, this is useful for modeling that does not assume a particular distribution anyway, such as neural networks. Standardization, on the other hand, can be applied if the data follow a normal distribution, but this is not necessarily the case. The important difference is that standardization, unlike normalization, does not limit the scale of results to a closed interval. This means that the characteristic of outliers remains.\n",
    "\n",
    "For normalization, scikit-learn offers the class ``MinMaxScaler()``, whose default parameters are already set to the interval [0, 1]. However, this interval can also be adjusted to individual intervals such as [-1, 1]. For standardization, the class ``StandardScaler()`` transforms the data to mean value zero and variance one.\n",
    "\n",
    "After superficial review, we will use normalization for the weather dataset and standardization for the insurance costs. We make this simplification due to time constraints of the lecture and it is not intended to claim to be the perfectly correct choice."
