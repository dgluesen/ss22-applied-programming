    "Version control systems (VCS) are key in companies or environments which plan to or work on larger software development projects. Of course, this includes Data Science and Machine Learning cases also. A VCS allows you to track code changes and enables collaboration across teams and their members. What else is there to know about VCS:\n",
    "* Developers can work together, but decouple certain tasks through **branching**\n",
    "* The history of changes is maintained by the VCS\n",
    "* All code, branches, changes, and the history is managed and stored in a **repository**\n",
    "* VCS can operate locally, centralized or distributed"

    "#### Commands for git and GitHub usage<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"versioning_commands\"></a>\n",
    "Before using git, you have to set up personalized information with\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git config --global user.name '[name]'\n",
    "git config --global user.email '[email address]'\n",
    "```\n",
    "After that, you can navigate to an **existing folder** or create a **new one** in a way of your choice. In the terminal/command prompt you now move to this folder and can **initialize** it via\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git init\n",
    "```\n",
    "to a folder versioned with git.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another possibility is to clone an **online available repository** to your own computer - for example from GitHub. To do this, use the following command:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git clone [url]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The **current state of the repository** can now be displayed by calling\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git status\n",
    "```\n",
    "in the directory. This means that the status of the local copy, whether there have been changes or updates, is displayed for the folder and the files. We now assume that **files have been newly added** to the directory or existing files have been **modified**. These files are now to be versioned, i.e. added to the repository. To do this,\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git add [filenames]\n",
    "```\n",
    "is called by specifying the explicit filenames or by using an abbreviated name using ``*`` (You can use ``*`` and ``.`` to add all files). This way the mentioned files are added to the **staging area**. Staging can be undone by git.\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git reset [filenames]\n",
    "```\n",
    "In the *local* repository, these **changes have to be committed**. Ideally this is done in combination with a comment on what has been added/changed. Git provides this command for this purpose:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git commit -m '[comment on updates]'\n",
    "```\n",
    "Up to this point, everything has happened in the local environment. Assuming that we are working with an online repository (for example, GitHub) that also involves other developers, these committed, locally versioned changes are now to be **transferred to the remote repository**.\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git push [alias] [branch]\n",
    "```\n",
    "As an alias, only the default name given by git to the server from which the repository was cloned is relevant for us at this point: ``origin``. For further information about aliases, please refer to [[9]](#git2021a) and [[10]](#git2021b). A branch can be understood as an independent development line in the project. It is therefore a new combination of working directory, staging area and project history, where new commits are only stored in the history of the active branch. The following graph illustrates this process."

Add the blank notebook directly to the repository and commit this first version with git, for example with the comment \"initial, blank version\".\n",
